# Room Boss Selection Implementation

## Overview
This document details the implementation plan for updating room.js to support random selection between the current boss and the new snake boss for room 3 encounters.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Existing Boss Spawning
The current room.js implementation spawns a boss in room 3:
```javascript
// Boss room (room 3)
if (room === 3) {
    const boss = new Boss(this.width/2, this.height/2, dungeon);
    enemies.push(boss);
    return enemies;
}
```

### Requirements
- Random selection between current boss and snake boss
- 50% chance for each boss type
- Selection is consistent within a single game session
- Both bosses share the same position and basic behavior

## Implementation Plan

### Random Selection Mechanism
The selection will be based on a random number generated once per game session:
```javascript
// In Game class constructor or initialization
this.bossType = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'current' : 'snake';
```

### Updated Room Generation
The room generation logic will be updated to use the selected boss type:
```javascript
// Boss room (room 3)
if (room === 3) {
    let boss;
    if (window.game && window.game.bossType === 'snake') {
        boss = new SnakeBoss(this.width/2, this.height/2);
    } else {
        boss = new Boss(this.width/2, this.height/2);
    }
    enemies.push(boss);
    return enemies;
}
```

## Integration Considerations

### Game Session Consistency
To ensure the boss type remains consistent throughout a game session:
1. Generate the random selection in the Game constructor
2. Store the selection as a property of the Game instance
3. Access the selection through `window.game.bossType`

### Boss Constructor Parameters
Both boss classes should accept the same parameters for consistency:
```javascript
// Current Boss constructor
constructor(x, y, dungeon) {
    super(x, y);
    // ... existing implementation
}

// SnakeBoss constructor (to match)
constructor(x, y, dungeon) {
    super(x, y);
    // ... snake boss implementation
}
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add Boss Type Selection
- Modify Game class to include boss type selection
- Add `bossType` property to Game class
- Generate random selection in constructor

### Step 2: Update Room Generation
- Modify RoomGenerator.generateEnemies method
- Add conditional logic for boss selection
- Ensure both boss types are imported

### Step 3: Verify Compatibility
- Check that both bosses work with existing systems
- Verify that room clearing mechanics work the same
- Test that scoring system is unaffected

### Step 4: Testing
- Test random selection works correctly
- Verify consistency within game sessions
- Check that both boss types can be selected

## Code Implementation

### Game Class Modification
```javascript
// In Game constructor
constructor() {
    // ... existing initialization code
    
    // Random boss selection for room 3
    this.bossType = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'current' : 'snake';
    
    // ... rest of constructor
}
```

### RoomGenerator Modification
```javascript
// Add import for SnakeBoss
import { SnakeBoss } from './enemies/snakeBoss.js';

// Updated generateEnemies method
generateEnemies(dungeon, room) {
    const enemies = [];
    
    // Boss room (room 3)
    if (room === 3) {
        let boss;
        if (window.game && window.game.bossType === 'snake') {
            boss = new SnakeBoss(this.width/2, this.height/2, dungeon);
        } else {
            boss = new Boss(this.width/2, this.height/2, dungeon);
        }
        enemies.push(boss);
        return enemies;
    }
    
    // ... rest of existing implementation
}
```

## Alternative Implementation

### Session-Wide Random Selection
Instead of a single random selection, we could allow for more variety:
```javascript
// Generate boss type for each boss room encounter
getBossType() {
    return Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'current' : 'snake';
}
```

However, this would require passing the selection to the RoomGenerator or storing it in a different way.

### Per-Run Selection
The current approach of selecting once per game session provides:
- Predictability within a run (player knows what to expect)
- Variety between runs
- Simpler implementation

## Testing Plan

### Selection Testing
- Verify that both boss types can be selected
- Check that selection is consistent within a session
- Test multiple game sessions for randomness

### Integration Testing
- Verify that both boss types work correctly in room 3
- Check that room clearing mechanics are unaffected
- Test that scoring works for both boss types

### Edge Case Testing
- Test with different dungeon levels
- Verify that boss scaling still works
- Check that all boss-specific features work correctly

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- The random selection adds minimal memory overhead
- Both boss classes are only loaded when needed
- No additional assets required for selection mechanism

### Processing Overhead
- Random selection happens only once per game session
- Conditional logic in room generation has minimal impact
- No additional processing during gameplay

## Future Enhancements

### Multiple Boss Types
The system could be extended to support more boss types:
```javascript
getBossType() {
    const types = ['current', 'snake', 'future_boss'];
    return types[Math.floor(Math.random() * types.length)];
}
```

### Weighted Random Selection
Different boss types could have different probabilities:
```javascript
getBossType() {
    const rand = Math.random();
    if (rand < 0.4) return 'current';
    if (rand < 0.8) return 'snake';
    return 'future_boss';
}
```

### Player Progression-Based Selection
Boss selection could be based on player progress:
```javascript
getBossType() {
    // New players get easier boss
    if (window.game.currentDungeon < 3) {
        return 'current';
    }
    // Experienced players get random boss
    return Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'current' : 'snake';
}
```

## Compatibility with Existing Systems

### Room Clearing
The boss selection does not affect room clearing mechanics:
- Same victory conditions apply
- Same enemy count (1 boss)
- Same item spawning behavior

### Scoring System
Both boss types will provide the same score:
- 1000 points for defeating any boss
- Consistent with existing implementation

### UI Integration
The boss selection is transparent to the UI:
- Same health bar display
- Same phase indicators (where applicable)
- Same death animations

## Error Handling

### Fallback Mechanism
If there are issues with the snake boss:
```javascript
// Boss room (room 3)
if (room === 3) {
    let boss;
    try {
        if (window.game && window.game.bossType === 'snake') {
            boss = new SnakeBoss(this.width/2, this.height/2, dungeon);
        } else {
            boss = new Boss(this.width/2, this.height/2, dungeon);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.warn('Failed to create snake boss, falling back to current boss', error);
        boss = new Boss(this.width/2, this.height/2, dungeon);
    }
    enemies.push(boss);
    return enemies;
}
```

### Missing Dependencies
The system should handle missing SnakeBoss class gracefully:
- Ensure proper imports
- Provide clear error messages
- Fall back to current boss if needed

## Documentation Updates

### Code Comments
Add comments to explain the boss selection mechanism:
```javascript
// Random boss selection for room 3
// Ensures variety between game sessions while maintaining consistency within a session
this.bossType = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'current' : 'snake';
```
